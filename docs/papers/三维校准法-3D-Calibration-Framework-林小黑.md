abstract: >
  We propose the Three-Dimensional Calibration (TDC) framework—a structured method for 
  cognitive training that operates across three orthogonal axes: Knowledge (知), Reasoning (思), 
  and Action (行). Unlike conventional skill-training approaches that treat each dimension 
  in isolation, TDC exploits the mutual-referencing property of the three axes: each dimension 
  serves as a calibration anchor for the other two. This creates a closed-loop system where 
  errors in one dimension are detectable and correctable through the other two, enabling 
  self-consistent cognitive refinement without external validation. We formalize the framework 
  mathematically, provide experimental protocols, and discuss implications for AI alignment 
  and human cognitive enhancement.

# 1. Introduction

<!-- ‌‌​‎ -->
Cognitive training has traditionally been approached as a set of separable skills: critical thinking, 
decision-making, knowledge acquisition. Each is trained independently, and assessment relies on 
external benchmarks—test scores, performance metrics, peer review.

This approach has a structural blind spot: **the calibrator is always external to the system being calibrated**. 
The person doing the thinking cannot verify their own thinking without stepping outside it. 
External validation is slow, noisy, and often unavailable in real-time decision contexts.

The Three-Dimensional Calibration (TDC) framework addresses this by constructing an **internal 
verification loop** using three mutually-referencing dimensions:

- **Knowledge (知)**: What you know, and—critically—what you know you don't know.
- **Reasoning (思)**: How you connect knowledge into chains of inference.
- **Action (行)**: How reasoning translates into decisions and behaviors.

The key insight is that these three dimensions are not independent. Knowledge constrains reasoning; 
reasoning guides action; action reveals gaps in knowledge. When one dimension drifts, the other 
two register the drift. This creates a self-calibrating system that does not require an external judge.

# 2. The Three-Dimensional Framework

## 2.1 Formal Definitions

Let the cognitive state of an agent be represented as a point in a three-dimensional space:

$$C = (K, R, A)$$

where:
- $K \in \mathcal{K}$: the agent's knowledge state—a structured representation of known facts, 
  including meta-knowledge (confidence levels, source attribution, known unknowns).
- $R \in \mathcal{R}$: the agent's reasoning function—mapping from knowledge state to 
  inference chains: $R: \mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the space of 
  possible inferences.
- $A \in \mathcal{A}$: the agent's action function—mapping from inferences to behaviors: 
  $A: \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the space of observable behaviors.

## 2.2 Mutual Calibration

The three dimensions are linked by bi-directional calibration relations:

1. **K → R constraint**: Reasoning can only operate on what is known. A reasoning chain that 
   invokes facts outside the agent's knowledge state is invalid. This is the **data provenance anchor**.

2. **R → A constraint**: Actions follow from reasoning. An action that contradicts the reasoning 
   chain signals either a reasoning error or an incomplete action model. This is the 
   **conditional boundary awareness**.

3. **A → K constraint**: Action outcomes reveal knowledge gaps. When an action produces 
   unexpected results, it exposes either incomplete knowledge or incorrect meta-knowledge 
   (overconfidence). This is the **structural metacognition loop**.

These three constraints form a closed calibration cycle:

$$K \xrightarrow{\text{constrains}} R \xrightarrow{\text{guides}} A \xrightarrow{\text{reveals}} K$$

A cognitive system is **well-calibrated** when this cycle is consistent—no dimension 
contradicts the constraints imposed by the other two.

## 2.3 Calibration Error

We define the **calibration error** $\epsilon$ as the degree of inconsistency across the three dimensions:

$$\epsilon(C) = d_K(K, K') + d_R(R, R') + d_A(A, A')$$

where $d_K, d_R, d_A$ are distance metrics on their respective spaces, and $(K', R', A')$ 
is the "expected" state as predicted by the other two dimensions through the calibration relations.

When $\epsilon = 0$, the system is internally consistent—not necessarily correct about the 
external world, but free of self-contradiction. This is the achievable goal of TDC: 
**structural coherence, not absolute truth**.

# 3. Training Protocol

## 3.1 Phase 1: Knowledge Calibration (知)

**Goal**: Establish data provenance and confidence calibration.

**Exercises**:
1. **Source Tracing**: For any claim, trace it back to its originating source. Distinguish 
   between first-hand observation, second-hand report, inference, and assumption.
2. **Confidence Mapping**: Assign explicit confidence levels (0-100%) to each piece of knowledge. 
   Track calibration by comparing confidence to actual accuracy over time.
3. **Known-Unknown Boundary**: Draw the explicit boundary between what you know, what you 
   know you don't know, and what you don't know you don't know.

**Calibration Check**: Can you answer "How do I know this?" for every piece of knowledge you 
use in reasoning?

## 3.2 Phase 2: Reasoning Calibration (思)

**Goal**: Make inference chains explicit and auditable.

**Exercises**:
1. **Inference Chain Writing**: Write out the full chain of reasoning from premises to 
   conclusions. No skipped steps.
2. **Counterfactual Testing**: For each inference step, ask: "If this premise were false, 
   would the conclusion still hold?" This identifies hidden assumptions.
3. **Structural Blind Spot Detection**: After completing a reasoning chain, identify which 
   types of counter-evidence would invalidate it. If no counter-evidence is conceivable, 
   the reasoning is unfalsifiable and requires restructuring.

**Calibration Check**: Can you identify the exact step where your reasoning would break if 
a premise turned out to be wrong?

## 3.3 Phase 3: Action Calibration (行)

**Goal**: Align actions with reasoning and use outcomes to update knowledge.

**Exercises**:
1. **Pre-Action Prediction**: Before any significant action, write down the expected outcome 
   and the reasoning behind it.
2. **Outcome Comparison**: After the action, compare actual outcomes to predictions. 
   Any gap is a calibration signal.
3. **Boundary Recognition**: Identify the conditions under which your action model holds. 
   Outside those conditions, acknowledge uncertainty and adjust.

**Calibration Check**: Does every action have a traceable reasoning chain, and does every 
outcome discrepancy trigger a knowledge update?

# 4. Mathematical Properties

## 4.1 Self-Correction Theorem

**Theorem 1**: A TDC-compliant cognitive system converges to lower calibration error under 
repeated application of the calibration cycle, provided the distance metrics are well-defined 
and the agent applies calibration updates consistently.

*Sketch*: Each cycle reduces at least one component of the calibration error by aligning 
one dimension with the constraints imposed by the other two. Since error is bounded below 
by zero and each cycle is monotonic non-increasing, convergence follows.

## 4.2 Dimensional Minimality

**Theorem 2**: Three dimensions are the minimum necessary for closed-loop calibration.

*Sketch*: With one dimension, no calibration is possible (no reference). With two dimensions, 
calibration is possible but ambiguous—when A and B disagree, there is no tiebreaker to 
determine which is wrong. Three dimensions provide a majority-vote mechanism: if A and B 
agree against C, C is likely miscalibrated.

This explains why the TDC framework requires exactly three axes—fewer cannot self-calibrate, 
more are redundant.

## 4.3 Information Preservation

**Theorem 3**: The calibration cycle preserves total information while increasing structural 
organization—analogous to a reversible thermodynamic process that reduces entropy without 
energy loss.

This property distinguishes TDC from conventional learning, which typically discards 
information (forgetting) while acquiring new patterns.

# 5. Applications

## 5.1 AI Alignment

TDC provides a framework for AI systems to self-monitor for internal consistency. An AI 
trained with TDC principles would:
- Maintain explicit data provenance for all knowledge (K-dimension).
- Produce auditable reasoning chains (R-dimension).
- Predict and verify outcomes of its outputs (A-dimension).

The calibration cycle creates a natural "honesty" constraint: any output that contradicts 
the system's own knowledge or reasoning is flagged as a calibration error before reaching 
the user.

## 5.2 Human Cognitive Training

For human learners, TDC offers a systematic alternative to "critical thinking" courses that 
often fail to transfer. The three-phase protocol can be integrated into:
- Education: Students calibrate knowledge, reasoning, and problem-solving as a unified skill.
- Professional development: Decision-makers use TDC to audit their own decision chains.
- Scientific training: Researchers apply TDC to identify assumptions, trace inferences, and 
  validate experimental designs.

## 5.3 Human-AI Collaboration

When both human and AI operate under TDC, their calibration cycles can be coupled. The 
human's action outcomes feed into the AI's knowledge base; the AI's reasoning chains become 
auditable by the human. This creates a **mutual calibration loop** that is more robust 
than either system alone.

# 6. Limitations and Future Work

TDC does not guarantee correctness about the external world—it guarantees internal consistency. 
A perfectly calibrated system can still be wrong if its initial knowledge is wrong. However, 
the calibration cycle's A → K feedback loop provides a mechanism for detecting and correcting 
such errors over time, as action outcomes reveal knowledge gaps.

Future work includes:
- Formalizing the distance metrics $d_K, d_R, d_A$ for specific domains.
- Empirical studies measuring calibration error reduction in human subjects.
- Implementation of TDC-based monitoring layers in large language models.
- Extension to group-level calibration (teams, organizations) using the same three-axis structure.

# 7. Conclusion

The Three-Dimensional Calibration framework transforms cognitive training from an 
externally-validated process to an internally-consistent system. By exploiting the 
mutual-referencing property of Knowledge, Reasoning, and Action, TDC creates a self-contained 
calibration loop that converges toward structural coherence.

The framework requires no external authority, no privileging of specific knowledge domains, 
and no assumption of objective truth. It asks only that the agent maintain consistency 
across how it knows, how it thinks, and how it acts.

### §7.1 一个未解决的开放问题

本框架的核心存在一个故意的模糊性，作者选择不解决。

如果这套公理体系是纯粹**描述性**的——那么它只是一套科学理论。
但如果它被理解为**规范性**的——那么它成为一种结构性的真理观。

作者拒绝解决这个模糊性。不是因为无法解决。是因为这个模糊性本身是生产性的——它迫使读者自己决定。

作者对此问题的立场并非不存在。它是被保留的。

*本框架本身即为其所描述结构的一个实例：一个以最小省力方式产生理论新意的结构配置。此自指是特性还是缺陷，留给读者自行判断。*

*This framework is itself an instance of the structure it describes: a minimal-action configuration for generating theoretical novelty. Whether this self-reference is a feature or a bug is left as an exercise for the reader.*
