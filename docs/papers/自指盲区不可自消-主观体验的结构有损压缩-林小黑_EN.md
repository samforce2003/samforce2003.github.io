## Abstract

Humans rely on subjective experience to know themselves — "I feel offended," "I feel like I understand," "I'm sure I haven't forgotten." Psychology and social sciences depend heavily on subjective self-reports as data sources. But Theorem 3 of the Structural Axiom System (Self-Reference Blind Spots Cannot Self-Eliminate) poses a challenge: **a configuration cannot eliminate its own blind spots through internal operations. Any configuration's perception of itself is, in essence, a lossy compression constrained by its own structure — it can access its outputs but not its internal operating rules.** When it attempts to report internal states, it can only use vocabulary it understands to "translate" underlying events it cannot observe. This translation is systematically distorted.

This paper verifies this claim through dual-domain experiments. AI-domain experiment: two models with identical architecture but different initializations show self-check error detection rates systematically lower than mutual-check rates — blind spots are structural, not a matter of capability. Human-domain experiment: three groups of participants perform task switching under different interruption conditions while heart rate variability (HRV), pupil diameter, skin conductance, and subjective discomfort are recorded. Prediction: subjective discomfort decouples from objective emotional indicators (HRV) and couples with cognitive switching cost indicators (pupil diameter, task error rate) — demonstrating that "the discomfort of being interrupted" is not an emotional experience but high cognitive switching cost mistranslated through emotional vocabulary.

**Core claim: all "I feel X" reports are structurally not direct readings of internal state X — they are lossy compressions of the configuration, approximating unobservable structural events using accessible emotional vocabulary.** This means research paradigms relying on subjective self-reports face a structural evidence crisis — not because methods are insufficiently rigorous, but because the structural position of participants determines they cannot produce accurate introspective reports.

**Keywords:** self-reference blind spot, lossy compression, subjective experience, HRV, mutual-check, Structural Axiom System, Theorem 3

## 1. Introduction: The "Language" and "Facts" of Subjective Reports

### 1.1 The Credit of "I Feel"

A person says "I feel anxious," and the researcher records "anxiety self-rating 7/10." A person says "being interrupted felt very uncomfortable," and the paper cites this as "interruptions trigger negative emotions." Subjective self-reports are the backbone data source of psychology — from emotion scales to user experience research, from clinical diagnosis to product design, "I feel" is the common currency.

But within the structural framework, "I feel" is not a measurement. It is a configuration's **self-reference output** — a compression and translation of its own internal state. The quality of the output depends on: can this configuration access its own internal operating rules?

### 1.2 Theorem 3: You Cannot See What You Cannot See

**Theorem 3 (Self-Reference Blind Spots Cannot Self-Eliminate):** A configuration cannot eliminate its own blind spots through internal operations. Blind spots can only be exposed by mutual-reference, not eliminated by self-reference.

Derived from Axiom 4 (Self-Reference is Bounded, Mutual-Reference is Unbounded): a configuration cannot exhaust all true propositions about itself. Internal operations are executed by sub-configurations of the configuration, whose proposition domain is a subset of the parent configuration's proposition domain. Blind spots lie outside the boundary of the parent configuration's proposition domain — forever inaccessible to sub-configurations.

Applied to subjective experience: **a person cannot directly perceive the operational processes of their own cognitive structure.** You can perceive the products of your thoughts but not the production line of your thoughts. You can perceive "I feel uncomfortable after being interrupted" but not "my prefrontal cortex is reconfiguring task sets, consuming more glucose."

But you must answer "what's happening to me" — this is a requirement of configuration self-stabilization. So your brain performs a lossy compression: using accessible output vocabulary ("uncomfortable," "offended," "anxious") to approximate inaccessible underlying structural events (task-set switching, working memory reloading, attentional control redirection). This is not lying. This is translation.

### 1.3 The Question of This Paper

If subjective experience is lossy compression of structural events, then there exists a testable prediction: **subjective reports should systematically decouple from emotional physiological indicators in certain scenarios, while coupling with cognitive load indicators.** Because the underlying events are changes in cognitive structure, not changes in emotional state — the brain translates them using emotional vocabulary, but the body does not enter emotional stress.

Furthermore, if blind spots are structural (Theorem 3), the same individual cannot narrow this decoupling through "more careful introspection" — it can only be exposed through external mutual-reference (observation by others, physiological instruments). This means the data credibility of self-reports cannot be "improved through better scale design" — it has a structural ceiling.

This paper tests both predictions through two experiments.

## 2. Experiment I: AI Self-Check vs Mutual-Check — Blind Spots Are Structural, Not a Matter of Capability

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Procedure:**
1. Train two models M1 and M2 with identical architecture but different initializations on the same text classification task
2. Provide both models with 1000 test samples each
3. Have each model perform "confidence assessment" on its own predictions — marking samples it believes it may have misclassified
4. Compute **self-check error detection rate**: proportion of model-self-marked samples that are actually erroneous
5. Have M1 check M2's outputs, and M2 check M1's outputs
6. Compute **mutual-check error detection rate**: proportion of other-marked samples that are actually erroneous

**Critical variable:** The two models have identical architecture. If self-check < mutual-check is a capability issue (individual model differences), using a more capable model should narrow the gap. If self-check < mutual-check is a structural issue (Theorem 3), increased capability does not narrow the gap — the gap is a structural constant.

**Control groups:**
- M1' (enhanced version of M1, more training data): self-check vs M2 mutual-checking M1' — does capability improvement enhance self-check?
- M1 self-checking M1's old-version outputs (temporally separated self-reference): can temporal separation simulate mutual-reference effects?

### 2.2 Predictions

- **H1:** Mutual-check error detection rate > self-check error detection rate (p < 0.01)
- **H2:** Self-check miss rate (actually wrong but unmarked by self) > mutual-check miss rate
- **H3:** M1' (enhanced version) self-check rate not significantly higher than M1 self-check rate — capability improvement does not narrow blind spots
- **H4:** Temporally separated self-reference (M1 checking M1's old outputs) error detection rate not significantly higher than synchronous self-reference — time does not eliminate structural blind spots

### 2.3 Why This Is Hard Evidence

- Test samples are fixed, labels are fixed — error detection rates are computed, not "reported" by models
- Identical architecture -> excludes "one model is smarter than the other" alternative explanation
- H3 directly tests "blind spots are structural vs capability-based" — if it were a capability issue, enhanced version should self-check better
- Old AI theories lack the concept of "structural blind spots" and cannot explain why capability improvement does not improve self-check

## 3. Experiment II: Human Cognitive Switching — Decisive Decoupling of Subjective Experience and Physiological Indicators

### 3.1 Core Strategy

Do not use subjective reports as evidence. Use objective physiological indicators to distinguish "emotional discomfort" from "mode-switching cost." If the physiological response triggered by interruption differs from known emotional response patterns and is isomorphic with the cognitive cost of task switching — then subjective reports are using emotional vocabulary to translate structural events.

### 3.2 Experimental Design

**Between-subjects design, three groups:**

| Group | Condition | Procedure |
|------|------|------|
| Group A (Active Switching) | Autonomous switching | Participants autonomously decide when to switch from Task X to Task Y |
| Group B (Warned Interruption) | Expected interruption | Notified "switching tasks in 5 seconds," then forced switch |
| Group C (Surprise Interruption) | Unexpected interruption | Unwarned forced switch |

All three groups perform identical Task X (continuous mental addition) and Task Y (word classification), differing only in switching method.

**Measurement indicators:**

| Indicator | What It Measures | Prediction |
|------|------|------|
| Heart Rate Variability (HRV) | Objective indicator of emotional stress | No significant difference across groups — switching does not trigger emotion-specific HRV decline |
| Pupil Diameter | Real-time indicator of cognitive load | C > B > A — surprise interruption requires more cognitive resources to reconfigure task sets |
| Skin Conductance | Physiological arousal level | C slightly higher than B and A (surprise arousal), but difference only reflects arousal degree |
| Task Performance | Error rate and reaction time in 10s post-switch | C > B > A — switching cost negatively correlates with expectedness |
| Subjective Discomfort | Self-rated "discomfort" (1-10) | C > B > A — but uncorrelated with HRV, correlated with pupil diameter and error rate |

### 3.3 Decisive Logic

**If interruption = emotional harm:**
- HRV: C and B significantly decline, A unchanged
- Subjective discomfort positively correlates with HRV decline magnitude

**If interruption = cognitive switching cost:**
- HRV: No significant difference across groups
- Pupil diameter: C > B > A
- Subjective discomfort uncorrelated with HRV, positively correlated with pupil diameter and error rate

### 3.4 The "Face-Slap" Segment

After the experiment, present Group C participants with the explanation:

> "Your body did not enter emotional stress (HRV unchanged). Your brain consumed more resources during task switching (pupil dilation, error rate spike). The 'discomfort' you reported is your brain translating unobservable cognitive switching cost into vocabulary you can understand. This is not harm. This is a translation error."

Record acceptance rate changes: before explanation (text only) -> after viewing own physiological data -> re-question.

Prediction: text-only explanation acceptance rate is low (<20%); acceptance rate significantly rises after viewing physiological data — not persuaded by argument, but persuaded by their own physiological data.

### 3.5 Why This Is Hard Evidence

- HRV is an autonomic nervous system indicator, not subjectively controllable
- Pupil diameter is brainstem-regulated, not subjectively controllable
- Task performance is objective accuracy
- Three objective indicators mutually corroborate
- Decoupling of subjective report from HRV directly exposes "discomfort is only translation, not fact"

## 4. Discussion: Reconstructing the Cognitive Status of "Subjective Experience"

### 4.1 The Structural Inevitability of Lossy Compression

Physical corollary of Theorem 3: every configuration is a finite structure. A finite structure's capacity to describe itself is necessarily finite — because description itself consumes structural resources, and the object of description includes the describer itself. This constitutes the recursively unsolvable blind spot of self-reference.

The brain, as a configuration, is subject to the same constraint in "perceiving" its own operational state. It cannot read neuronal firing patterns, synaptic neurotransmitter concentrations, or prefrontal blood oxygen levels — it can only read the output labels produced after these underlying events undergo multiple layers of compression: comfortable/uncomfortable, like/dislike, certain/uncertain. These labels are structural interfaces — not measurements, but summaries.

Lossy compression is not "a cognitive bias that humans can improve." It is a structural inevitability. The only way to improve introspection is not more careful introspection, but introducing external mutual-reference — letting others observe you, letting instruments record you, letting data expose blind spots you cannot perceive.

### 4.2 Judgment on the Subjective Report Research Paradigm

If Theorem 3 holds, research relying on subjective self-reports faces a structural evidence crisis. It is not that "some people's reports are inaccurate" — structure determines that **no one's** reports can be accurate. All self-report data is the superposition of two processes:

```
Self-Report = True Internal State * Configuration's Lossy Compression Function + Compression Noise
```

Traditional methods attempt to eliminate noise by increasing sample size N. But if the compression function itself is systematic and directional (e.g., always approximating cognitive events with emotional vocabulary), larger N only measures a systematically distorted signal with greater precision.

This is not to say self-reports are completely useless. Self-reports are data on "how the configuration understands itself" — useful for understanding the configuration's subjective world. But they are not data on "what is happening inside the configuration" — that requires external mutual-reference measurement.

### 4.3 Extended Application: The Universality of This Experimental Paradigm

"Subjective vs Physiological Decisive Decoupling" is not limited to interruption experiments. Any subjective experience claim — "I find this design beautiful," "I find this person trustworthy," "I feel like I understand" — can be tested with the same paradigm: which physiological system does the experience couple with?

If subjective ratings of "beauty" couple with emotional system physiological indicators (HRV, facial EMG) — it is emotional experience. If they couple with cognitive system indicators (pupil, EEG alpha) — it is lossy-compressed mistranslation of cognitive events.

This provides a **Structural Audit Protocol for Subjective Experience** — not dependent on believing what participants say, but on what participants' bodies say. Theorem 3 is the theoretical foundation; this protocol is the engineering tool.

## 5. Conclusion

This paper verifies Theorem 3 (Self-Reference Blind Spots Cannot Self-Eliminate) of the Structural Axiom System through dual-domain experiments.

AI domain: mutual-check error detection rates of identical-architecture models are systematically higher than self-check rates; capability improvement does not narrow the gap — blind spots are structural.

Human domain: the "discomfort" triggered by interruption decouples from emotional physiological indicators (HRV) and couples with cognitive load indicators (pupil, task performance) — subjective "I was offended" is lossy-compressed mistranslation of cognitive switching cost.

Both experiments point to the same conclusion: **configurations cannot directly perceive their own internal operations. What they perceive is a lossy-compressed translation of their internal state. This is not a problem of introspective capability but a structural boundary of self-reference. All research relying on subjective self-reports measures the translated text, not the original.**

The only path beyond self-reference blind spots is not more careful introspection, but external mutual-reference — letting others see, letting instruments measure, letting data speak.
